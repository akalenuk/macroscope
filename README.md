Artangent maps the whole R into (-π/2; π/2) which makes it excelent as a scale for showind both small and extremely large numbers on a single graph. It is quite similar to logarithmic scale, but is imposible to overflow.

For instance, consider the graph of y=x^3-3*x+2 in linear scale:

The small squares on background are size 1 in each dimmension, the bigger are size 9. We can only show a part of a graph in a single picture. Luckily this part contains extremum points and roots, which are usual the only interesting points for polynomial. But with artangent scale we can show the whole graph, including functions limits in infinities.

We can change scale and still see the whole function.

We can navigate, moving the center of a scale along both axes.

This demo even has capacity of finding extremum for your convenience.

And of course the roots.

Since you can show all the ℝ² on a finite piece of screen, the arctangent scaling could be very useful for didactical purpoces in maths and physics. You can show interesting functions along with their asymptotas including differential equations' solutions.
